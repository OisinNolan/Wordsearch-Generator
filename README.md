# Wordsearch_Generator
A wordsearch generator webpage written with html5 and vanilla javascript. This was made as a project for a module at university.

The wordsearch generation algorithm uses backtracking to try placing each of the words at any possible position in any possible
direction. The algorithm is inspired by a backtracking solution to the N-Queens problem.
